###Project Proposal###

I recently picked up the sport of Disc Golf. Where it has very similar rules to golf but
instead of clubs and balls, you throw discs and try to land them in metal baskets scattered
throughout the course. I have been playing for about 8 months now and I’ve noticed how in depth
this sport is. Firstly, it is still a relatively new sport, but it’s on the rise. I had the initial
idea of designing an app for tracking score similar to golf apps, but I also had a couple more ideas
for it. One being a feature that shows you what disc is best for what type of hole.

There are 3 main types of discs, those being a driver, midrange, and a putter, and each of those
discs have 4 numbers that vary to represent speed, glide, turn, and fade. In a nutshell it is much
more then throwing a frisbee and seeing what sticks, there is tactic on what disc to use for the
right occasion. For example, I have a driver called the Leopard, I use it for extremely
long drives because it has a really low turn value, meaning when I throw it a certain way it goes
a lot farther due to it needs to turn over before it fades off. The same can be said with each
disc, they are all unique. The feature would allow the user to input the values each of their
discs have and maps out the predicted flight pattern of that said disc. So when you step up to
a tee-box you know exactly what to throw and how to throw it.

I really think it would be fun to make a scorecard app, but I also want to
incorporate the feature of showing what disc to use because I feel that hasn’t been done as much
as a scorecard app.
