####Project Proposal Final Draft####

The Problem:
I recently picked up the sport of disc golf, which is golf but instead of clubs and golf balls it
is discs and chained baskets. You are basically throwing different types of frisbees hundreds of
feet almost following the same rules of actual golf, but it is a bit more complicated then that.
There are 3 types of discs: drivers, mid-ranges, and putters, and each of these discs have 4 types
of variables on how they fly. Those being speed, turn, glide, and fade. With all that information it
can be really difficult for a new player to understand how these discs work.

A Solution:
An app that's a hybrid of a scorecard app and an app that you can input each number on your disc and
it will draw out the flight pattern of that certain disc. Basically letting new players learn how their
discs will fly and allowing them to maximize each discs' potential for any situation.

Deliverables:
-The app will have a feature to track score up to 18 holes.
-The app will have a feature to input all the discs flying variables and map out the flight pattern
of that said disc.
-The app will contain a light tutorial session about discs, the types of discs, and each number on
disc to help the user understand more about disc golf.

User Stories:

-Billy is new to the sport of disc golf and his dad bought him a starter set. Upon opening is starter
set he notices each disc feels different and there are 4 numbers on each of the discs and they are
almost all different in each category. Billy downloads the app and inputs each number from his discs
and realizes those numbers show how each of his discs will fly. Billy is now very happy he has a base
understanding of each of his discs and is eager to play!

-John has been playing disc golf for almost a year now and is tired of tracking his score using
pencil and paper, so he downloads the disc golf app to allow himself to track his score from the
comfort of his phone.
